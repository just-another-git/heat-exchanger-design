# heat-exchanger-design
Code that designs(provides area, number of tubes, and overall Heat Transfer Coefficient) either 1-x Shell&amp;Tube or 2-x Shell&amp;Tube Heat Exchanger for Heavy Naphtha as the hot fluid and Towns Water as the coolant.

A 5 week project in the course Process Equipment Design - I Laboratory CH39023 of the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur.
The code had to automatically iterate through the steps for various inputs. The Code can successfully replicate the Process Design of the Heat Exchanger. The other parts of the problem were Mechanical Design, and the Engineering Drawings of the designed equipment.
